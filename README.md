 ## `Conclusion`
This is all analysis which can be performed on the available data.<br/>
 The above analysis is not just the few graphs it gives the complete information of count with respect to states.<br/>
 The severity in state can be found with respect to other states.<br/>
 State dealing the best by having maximum cured cases.<br/>
 State suffering the most by having the highest death case count.<br/>
 Confirmed cases vs date help to analyse how it is spreading in India.<br/>
 Cured case vs date help to know the cured time required.<br/>
 India confirmed case of all states vs date gives us the insights of its growth with time.<br/>
 **Hence,the above analysis can be maintain in real time by updating data to get the more insights.**
