The first case of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic in India was reported on January 30,2020, originating from China.
The country reported its first three cases in Kerala, all of whom were students who had returned from Wuhan, China.
The transmission escalated in the month of March, after several cases were reported all over the country, most of which were linked to people with a travel history to affected countries.

On 10th March, the total cases reached 50.
On 12th March, a 76-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia became the first victim of the virus in the country. 
The total cases reached 100 on 15th March, 250 on 20th March and 500 on 24th March.The death toll reached 10 on 24th March.
The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7, which is remarkably lower than in the worst affected countries.
Currently,there is no vaccination or medicine available for this disease so maintaing social distance is the only solution left.
To limit the spread of virus government of India announced lockdown in all states and union territories from 25th march 2020 for 21 days.For more information [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_India).

From available data,we can visualize how the virus infected population increased in last 55 days.
This analysis will help us to **compare the count with respect to time and place**.This analysis helps us in visualizing **current situation** on map which will help in **tracking corona virus affected cases all over India in real time.**
The data used in the analysis starts from first confirmed case record date i.e.,*30 Jan 2020 to 23 March 2020*.To keep analysis up to date and accurate more data can be added into it.The data used in repo is represented in csv format(you can also refer [link1](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india), [link2](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/covid19-corona-virus-india-dataset) and [link3](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset)).

Let us get into analysis to get more insights from available data.

 ## `Conclusion`
 All these analysis can be performed on available data.<br/>
 The above analysis is not just the few graphs it gives the complete information of count with respect to states.<br/>
 The severity in the state can be found with respect to other states.<br/>
 The state having maximum cured cases refer as best dealing state from corona virus<br/>
 State suffering the most by having the highest death case count.<br/>
 Confirmed cases vs date help to analyse how it is spreading in India.<br/>
 Cured case vs date help to know the cured time required.<br/>
 India confirmed case of all states vs date gives us the insights of its growth with time.<br/>
 **Hence,the above analysis can be maintain in real time by updating data to get the more insights.**
